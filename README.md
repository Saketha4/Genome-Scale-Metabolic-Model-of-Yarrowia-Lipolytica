# Metabolic-Model-of-Yarrowia-lypolytica

Yarrowia lipolytica is an industrially relevant yeast known for its capabilities in lipid accumulation, organic acid production, and biotechnological applications. This genome-scale metabolic model (GEM) aims to capture the metabolic network of Y. lipolytica to explore its potential in areas such as biofuel production, bioremediation, and biomanufacturing of valuable compounds. The goal of this model is to provide a computational tool that enables researchers to simulate and predict the metabolic behavior of Y. lipolytica under various conditions.
